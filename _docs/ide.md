## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Using an IDE is necessary in the modern world of development.  
IDEs provide language linting, build tools, debugging, framework  
plugins, and many other useful features. Knowing how to use a lot  
of the IDE features is very beneficial in developing code faster.  

**Which IDE To Use?**  
A couple of the best IDEs out there are [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
It is highly recommended to use one or the other. JetBrains offers  
different IDEs for different languages, but IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate  
is their single IDE for all languages - which requires a paid license.  
VS Code on the other hand is free. It's all about personal preference.  
The job can surely  get done in VS Code, but there are more features  
in the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate IDE. Both are used throughout enterprises.

Download one or the other, and get familiarized with the features.  
There is tons of information about bothe IDEs online.
